# ⏱️ How Long Does It Take to Beat Neural Break?

**TL;DR:** Between **20-60 hours** depending on skill level

---

## 📊 Mathematical Analysis

### Level Duration Calculation

Each level's duration depends on:
1. **Objective count** - How many enemies to kill
2. **Spawn rates** - How fast enemies appear
3. **Player efficiency** - Kill rate and survival
4. **Deaths** - Restart penalty

### Scaling Formulas

**Difficulty Scale:**
```
difficultyScale = 1 + (level - 1) × 0.03
```
- Level 1: 1.0x (baseline)
- Level 50: 2.47x (247% harder)
- Level 99: 3.94x (394% harder!)

**Spawn Rate Scale:**
```
spawnScale = max(0.3, 1 - (level - 1) × 0.008)
```
- Enemies spawn progressively faster
- Caps at 0.3x (70% faster than baseline)
