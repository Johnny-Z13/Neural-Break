- Visual effects system
- Lighting and post-processing

### Player - Character Control

Player entity with movement, combat, and progression.

**Systems:**
- Analog movement (keyboard + gamepad)
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- Dash ability with cooldown
- Health and damage system
- Power-up collection
- Shield and invulnerability

### EnemyManager - Spawn Control

Manages enemy spawning and lifecycle.

**Features:**
- Spatial grid for efficient collision detection

---

## Entity System

## Graphics System

### EffectsSystem

Modular particle and visual effects.

**Modules:**
- `ParticlePool` - Base particle system

- `VectorParticles` - Vector-style particles

**Performance:**
- Object pooling
- Efficient memory management
- Throttled updates
- Culling off-screen effects

---

## Data Systems

### HighScoreService

Persistent score storage.

---

## Configuration System

### balance.config.ts

Master configuration file.

**Sections:**
- Player stats
- Weapon stats
- Enemy configs (all 8 types)
- Pickup spawn rates
- Scoring system
- Level progression
- Visual effects

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- Easy tuning
- Type-safe values
- Hot reload

---

## Collision System

### Spatial Grid

Optimized collision detection.

**How It Works:**
1. World divided into grid cells
2. Entities register in cells
3. Collision checks only nearby cells
4. O(neighbors) instead of O(n²)

**Performance:**
- ~100x faster than brute force
- Scales with entity count
- Minimal memory overhead

---

## State Management

### GameState

Tracks current game state.

**States:**
- `START_SCREEN` - Main menu
- `PLAYING` - Active game
- `GAME_OVER` - End screen
- `PAUSED` - Game paused

### GameStats

Tracks player statistics.

**Data:**
- Score, level, time
- Kills by enemy type
- Damage taken
- Combo/multiplier records
- Power-ups collected

---

## Design Patterns

### Used Patterns

**Factory Pattern**
- `HighScoreServiceFactory` - Create appropriate service

**Object Pool Pattern**
- Projectiles, particles, enemies
- Reduces garbage collection

**Observer Pattern**
- Event callbacks for state changes
- UI updates on game events

**Strategy Pattern**
- Different enemy behaviors
- Mode-specific logic

**Singleton Pattern**
- `StarfieldManager` - Global starfield
- `HighScoreServiceFactory` - Service instance

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management

✅ Object pooling for frequent allocations  
✅ Proper cleanup on state transitions  
✅ No memory leaks (verified)  
✅ Efficient particle systems  

### Rendering

✅ Throttled camera zoom (50ms)

## Code Organization

### Separation of Concerns

Each file has a single responsibility:

- ✅ Configuration separate from code
- ✅ Data separate from presentation

### Modular Architecture

Systems are loosely coupled:
- ✅ Communication through Game coordinator
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Easy to test individually
- ✅ Easy to extend

### Type Safety

Full TypeScript coverage:
- ✅ Interfaces for all entities
- ✅ Strict null checks
- ✅ No `any` types
- ✅ Type-safe configs

## File Structure Logic

```
src/
├── config/           # Configuration (balance, game settings)
├── core/             # Core game systems (managers, state)
├── entities/         # Game entities (player, enemies, pickups)
├── weapons/          # Combat system (projectiles, weapons)
├── graphics/         # Rendering (scene, effects, particles)
├── ui/               # User interface (screens, HUD)
├── audio/            # Sound system (manager, pool, music)
├── data/             # Data persistence (high scores)
└── utils/            # Utilities (location service, helpers)
```

**Logic:**
- `config/` = Data (what)
- `core/` = Logic (how)
- `entities/` = Objects (what)
- `graphics/` = Visual (how it looks)
- `ui/` = Interface (player interaction)

---

## Best Practices

### Code Style

✅ Descriptive variable names  
✅ Single responsibility functions  
✅ Clear comments for complex logic  
✅ Consistent formatting  
✅ Type annotations everywhere  

### Error Handling

✅ Graceful degradation  
✅ Fallback systems  
✅ Console warnings for debugging  
✅ Never crash the game  

### Testing

✅ Verify builds before commit  
✅ Test all game modes  
✅ Check performance  
✅ Verify high scores work
